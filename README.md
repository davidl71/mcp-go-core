# mcp-go-core

**Core MCP Infrastructure Library for Go**

A shared library containing common MCP (Model Context Protocol) infrastructure code extracted from `exarp-go` and `devwisdom-go` projects.

## Purpose

This library provides reusable components for building MCP servers in Go, including:

- Framework abstraction layer
- Security utilities (path validation, project root detection)
- Structured logging
- CLI utilities (TTY detection)
- JSON-RPC protocol types
- Common types and interfaces
- Platform detection
- Build system patterns
- CI/CD workflow templates

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/davidl71/mcp-go-core
```

## Usage

```go
import (
    "github.com/davidl71/mcp-go-core/pkg/mcp/framework"
    "github.com/davidl71/mcp-go-core/pkg/mcp/security"
    "github.com/davidl71/mcp-go-core/pkg/mcp/logging"
)
```
